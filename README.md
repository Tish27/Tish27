### <center>Hi, I'm Theryze Santos ðŸ‘‹</center>

I am currently pursuing the Data Science and Analytics track to test the limitless capabilities of Big Data and how the meaningful insights that can be drawn from processed information can aid companies in the implementation and development of appropriate business strategies.

With a strong passion for learning whether academically or not, I occasionally watch tutorial videos and explore subject matters that are not familiar to me. I aim to use these knowledge as catalysts for change in either the business setting or the society as a whole. 

In my free time, I often listen to music and play computer games.
